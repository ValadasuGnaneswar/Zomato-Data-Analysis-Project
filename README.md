# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Project
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset using Python, uncovering key insights related to restaurant trends, cuisines, ratings, and locations.

📊 Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset
Explore relationships between features such as location, rating, cost, and cuisine
Visualize insights using charts and graphs
Provide business recommendations for food delivery services or restaurant owners

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes restaurant information from Zomato:
Restaurant names
Locations
Ratings
Average losts
Types of cuisines served
Online delivery availability

📌 Key Highlights
Top restaurant types and their ratings
City-wise distribution of restaurants
Popular cuisines and their impact on customer ratings
Impact of cost on restaurant ratings
Online ordering trends

📉 Visualizations
This project uses the following visual tools:
Bar charts
Heatmaps
Pie charts
Box plots
These help identify patterns in customer behavior and business performance.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Handled null values
Removed duplicates
Standardized categorical columns (e.g., cost, ratings)
Encoded binary features (like online delivery)

📈 Insights Derived
Restaurants with online delivery tend to have slightly higher ratings
North Indian and Chinese cuisines dominate the dataset
Bangalore and Delhi NCR have the highest number of listings
Medium-priced restaurants tend to receive better reviews than extremely low- or high-cost ones

📝 How to Run
